# Snake Game in Terminal

This is a snake game running in **Linux** Terminal written by python.

## IMPORTANT!!

The game is based on 'curses' module in python and is written and tested only on Linux terminal (more specifically Manjaro Konsole).

If you want to run it on windows, please install `UniCurses` module first. [UniCurses github page](https://github.com/unicurses/unicurses)

## Rules and Operations

The rules of the game are exactly the same with the classic one. I wrote it as a practice for 'curses' module and a demo for our python group project.

Player can use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Continuous press on the same key will increase the speed of the snake.
