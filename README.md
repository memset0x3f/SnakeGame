# Snake Game in Terminal

This is a snake game running in **Linux** Terminal written by python. I wrote it as a practice for 'curses' module and a demo for our python group project.

## IMPORTANT!!

The game is based on 'curses' module in python and is written and tested only on Linux environment (more specifically Archlinux/Manjaro).

If you want to run it on windows, please install `UniCurses` module first. [UniCurses github page](https://github.com/unicurses/unicurses)

## Rules and Operations

The rules of the game are exactly the same with the classic one. 

Player can use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Continuous press on the same key will increase the speed of the snake.
